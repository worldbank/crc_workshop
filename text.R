p1_2 <- 'Spatial Layers Viewer'
p1_3 <- 'for the 2023 Climate-Resilient Cities Workshop in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This Viewer provides an interactive and collaborative way to explore some of the key characteristics of your cities and the resilience challenges they face.'
p2 <- 'Select your city from the list on the right or from the City Profiles tab. Then select from the 20 available data layers to view spatial information about your city. The most recently selected layer will appear on the top of the map. By selecting different sets of layers and changing their opacity with the sliders next to each layer name, you can draw insights about your city\'s development and exposure to climate change and disasters.'
# p3 <- 'You can also select the Regional Climate Projections tab to view historical and projected comparisons of drought conditions, heat, and precipitation across 15 cities in the Balkans. The bottom of the page shows comparative graphs of the cities in 1990 and 2020, as well as the projected change from 1990 to 2040. Note how cities are projected to change relative to one another compared to their historical conditions.'
p4 <- 'Change the zoom level of your browser to show more or less of the graph underneath the map, or view the graph by scrolling down.'
p5 <- 'This Viewer is intended to build dialogue and shared lessons around cities\' most pressing resilience challenges. It is designed as a conversation starter rather than a direct decision-making tool. Thinking spatially about how urban development affects long-term resilience helps to develop risk-informed investment proposals, identify opportunities and barriers to unlocking private capital, and prioritize and coordinate future investments.'
p6 <- 'What patterns did this Viewer illustrate that you had not considered before?'
p7 <- 'How will your insights from this Viewer inform your investment priorities?'
p8 <- 'Which areas of the city require specific kinds of investments, and in what sectors?'
p9 <- 'What investments need to be prioritized? What tradeoffs does your prioritization bring?'
p10 <- 'What investments can be coordinated? What are the benefits of this coordination?'
p11 <- 'About the City Resilience Program'
p12 <- 'Established in June 2017, the World Bank\'s City Resilience Program (CRP) empowers cities to invest in climate and disaster resilience. The CRP has assembled a diverse range of World Bank sectoral expertise as a global technical support system to assist cities in integrating climate change and disaster risk into their upstream capital investment planning and access the financing needed for climate-smart investments to succeed. Rather than trade off between competing sectoral needs, the CRP helps cities tackle their most pressing development challenges through integrated, cross-sectoral, spatially-based priorities that capture the interaction between the natural and built environments.'
